## Tiago in Firestation

### Signal Prompts

The Firestation object pickup scenario is a crucial component of the autonomous fire response coordination system. In this scenario, the Tiago robot is tasked with picking up various objects from the firestation, such as fire extinguishers, medical kits, and other emergency supplies. The goal is to ensure that these objects are readily available for deployment during fire emergencies.

**How it works:**
1. **Detection:** Tiago utilizes advanced sensors to detect the location of the required objects in the firestation.
2. **Navigation:** Once detected, Tiago navigates to the object’s location while avoiding obstacles and ensuring a safe path.
3. **Pickup:** The robot uses its manipulator to pick up the object and securely store it for transport.
4. **Deployment:** After securing the necessary items, Tiago can either deliver them to a designated location or prepare them for immediate use in emergency situations.
